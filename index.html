        Hi, I'm a project manager and one of the programmers for Team Zootopia. I help keep the team organized and on track, while also working on the technical side of our game — spefically the gameplay systems and mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always loved games, as a player and as a designer. I enjoy thinking about how games feel to play and how even small mechanics can shape the overall experience. Ourside of game development, I'm into music — both listening and playing whenever I have the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is where I'll be documenting my personal progress, relfections, and lessons learned throughout this project.
