        Hi, I'm a project manager and one of the programmers for Team Zootopia. I help keep the team organized and on track, while also working on the technical side of our game — spefically the gameplay systems and mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always loved games, as a player and as a designer. I enjoy thinking about how games feel to play and how even small mechanics can shape the overall experience. Ourside of game development, I'm into music — both listening and playing whenever I have the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is where I'll be documenting my personal progress, relfections, and lessons learned throughout this project.

      <h2>Week 1–2: Project Setup</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past two weeks, I’ve been getting more comfortable with the project and the team workflow. Early on, things felt a bit uncertain — there were a lot of ideas on the table, and it took some time to understand how everything would actually come together. Through group discussions and meetings, I’m starting to see the bigger picture more clearly and how each part of the project connects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I’ve been focusing on listening, asking questions, and figuring out where my strengths fit best within the team. Taking on the role of PM has meant thinking a lot about organization and keeping things on track, while also making sure everyone is on the same page. I was also in charge of setting up and started maintaining the team blog (this one, hi), which has been a good way to document our progress and keep things transparent for the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also one of the programmers on the team. For the next iteration, I want to start digging into tools like Unity and learning how to implement some of the core mechanics and overall feel of the game. Since our game is leaning toward a mix of side-scrolling, visual novel, and platformer elements, I’ll be focusing mainly on the platforming side for now. My goal is to get movement feeling clean and responsive so we have a solid foundation to build on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward, I want to be more proactive both as a PM and as a programmer — helping keep deliverables on track while also contributing more technically. I’m excited to start turning our ideas into something playable and to learn from whatever challenges come up along the way.
